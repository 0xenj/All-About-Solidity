Upgradeability: be careful when the contract get upgraded that it is initialised properly.

Use Pausable on the contract, to pause any interaction while making fixes, or if it got exploited.

Visibility: keep things closed, and open it up.

Be very careful with initialize(â€¦) functions!!!

You should never audit your own code. You should get a new pair of eyes, because you are developing and you are in a particular mindset, so you are creating the bug.
