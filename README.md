**All About Solidity** is an article serie that covers most of the core feature, syntax and semantics of Solidity, the smart contract programming language for Ethereum or any EVM based blockchains.

You will find code snippets and analogies that will help you understand and improve your Solidity programming skills.

**Enjoy the reading!**
